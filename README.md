# Portfolio

Author: James Carson

## Introduction
This is a portfolio of some example work showing my coding style and practices.

Thank you for taking the time to review my samples.

## Eulers
Brute force approaches were taken with most of the Euler problems because I am not trying to show my great math skills. Instead I am attempting to show how I organize, label, and write code.

All Eulers are tested using the default or preferred unit test frame work of that language. If there is not a default or preferred unit test framework, then the tests will be executed using bash scripts.
