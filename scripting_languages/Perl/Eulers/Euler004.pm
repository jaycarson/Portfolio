=head1 NAME

Euler004 - This script is to solve the following Euler Problem:

=head1 SYNOPSYS

Euler004.pm [OPTION]... [PARAMETER]...

=head1 Description

Euler Problem 004:

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome
made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 12

=item C<restrict>

This is a numeric parameter used to restrict the calculation. Usage: "perl perl_template.pm restrict=10"
